# network-monitoring-ai
This project is designed for monitoring, analyzing user behavior, managing bandwidth, and extracting data from Fortigate 60F.

🎯 Project Objectives
Monitoring and optimizing network and internet resources for organizational users
Collecting logs and behavioral data from Fortigate 60F and user systems
Storing and processing data (Batch & Stream)
Unified dashboard for daily and weekly reporting

🏗️ Main Components of the Scenario
Data Sources :
  🔹 Fortigate 60F → Syslog transmission (traffic, web, users)
  🔹 Agent on user systems (e.g., Wazuh/Osquery/Winlogbeat) → Tracks visited websites and running processes
  🔹 File Server (Winlogbeat) → Logs for file access and modifications


Ingestion Layer:
  🔹 Kafka (Streaming) → For real-time log collection
  🔹 Logstash or Filebeat → For batch/log transmission
  🔹 Fluentd/FluentBit (optional) → For lightweight log collection


Processing Layer
  🔹 Apache Spark → Batch analysis (daily/weekly)
  🔹 Kafka Stream or Logstash → Real-time analysis
  🔹 Airflow → Scheduling ETL and periodic processing


Storage Layer
  🔹 PostgreSQL → Structured data (users, websites, bandwidth usage)
  🔹 MongoDB → Semi-structured data (JSON from agents)
  🔹 TimescaleDB or InfluxDB → Time-series data (real-time traffic)


Visualization Layer
  🔹 Grafana → Unified dashboard (real-time + daily/weekly reports)
  🔹 Connection to PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Elasticsearch (optional for search)

🔐 Security and DevOps
  - All services are executed in Docker Compose.
  - Access is secured with a Reverse Proxy (NGINX + SSL).
  - Agents send data to the central server via TLS/SSL.
  - CI/CD for seamless updates (Git + Docker).
